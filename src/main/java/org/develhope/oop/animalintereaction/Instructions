4-  Create an Animal Interaction System using an interface, an abstract class, and inheritance.

Steps:

a. Create an Interface AnimalInteraction with the following methods:

void feed(String food);
void play();
void showInteractionHistory();

b.Create an Abstract Class SimpleAnimal that implements AnimalInteraction:

Implement the feed method. It should ask for the food provided and store the feeding interaction in a list.
Implement the play method. When called, it should store "play interaction" in the interaction history.
Implement the showInteractionHistory method to display all interactions with the animal (both feedings and play sessions).
Store interaction history using an appropriate data structure, like an ArrayList<String>.

c.Create Concrete Classes:

Extend SimpleAnimal into two classes, such as Dog and Cat, with additional unique behaviors:
In the Dog class, add a method bark() that prints "The dog is barking!".
In the Cat class, add a method meow() that prints "The cat is meowing!".

d.Testing the System:

Create instances of both Dog and Cat, interact with them by feeding and playing with them.
Display their interaction histories using showInteractionHistory.

Bonus: Add a method void sleep(int hours) to SimpleAnimal where it stores the sleep interaction as "Slept for X hours".
